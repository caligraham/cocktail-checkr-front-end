# Welcome to Cocktail CheckR!

[Click here for back-end repository!](https://github.com/killacalical/cocktail-checkr-back-end)

Do you love cocktails!? Or maybe you have a strong dislike for the mint in a Mojito? Have you always wanted to share these thoughts with the world wide web? Well, Cocktail CheckR is the place for you!

I made this project because I spent 10+ years in the service industry slangin' dranks! I wanted to create a project on a topic that I love and cherish, and showcase some of my favorite cocktails.
